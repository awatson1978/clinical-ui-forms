clinical-ui-forms
========================

Meteor app demonstrating form elements, controls, and other features.  
Demo available at:  [http://clinical-ui-forms.meteor.com](http://clinical-ui-forms.meteor.com)  


------------------------
### Notes

This applet demonstrates how to use <input> elements with a pure-Meteor CRUD pattern.  It doesn't use form tags, and it doesn't auto-build a form using a JSON object.  It's intent is for the form builder who wants a high degree of granularity and control in builder his or her user interfaces.

### Pull Requests Accepted

Will happily accept pull requests if people want to add form elements to this applet.  Looking to create a full featured form library for Clinical applications.  Looking for a minimalistic, responsive, and mobile friendly design.  So, be aware that things like radiobuttons, datepickers, dropdowns, and other UI elements are subject to change and refinement.
